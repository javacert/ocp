// Notes:
// 1. This feature is also known as automatic resource management, because Java automatically takes care of the closing.
// 2. There is no finally block in the try-with-resources code. The finally clause exists implicitly. You just donâ€™t have to type it.
// 3. Remember that only a try-with-resources statement is permitted to omit both the catch and finally blocks.
//    A traditional try statement must have either or both.
// 4. A try-with-resources statement is still allowed to have catch and/ or finally blocks. They are run in addition to the implicit one.
// 5. The implicit finally block runs before any programmer-coded ones.
// 6. You cannot have 2 or more manually written finally blocks in a traditional try block, nor in the try-with-resources, but
//    try-with-resources does have the implicit plus 1 defined finally (optional).
// 7. The resources created in the try clause are only in scope within the try block. This is because the implicit finally
//    block runs first to close the resources, so is not available to catch or finally.
// 8. In order for a class to be created in the try clause, Java requires it to implement an interface called AutoCloseable.
//    It has 1 method: public void close() throws Exception;
//    The AutoCloseable interface is saying that implementers may throw any exceptions they choose because an overriding method
//    is allowed to declare more specific exceptions than the parent or even none at all.
//    Java strongly recommends that close() not actually throw Exception. It is better to throw a more specific exception.
// 9.  Java closes resources in the reverse order from which it created them.
