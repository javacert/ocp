// Notes:
// 1. Internationalization is the process of designing your program so that it can be adapted.
// 2. This might involve placing stings in a property file using classes like DateFormat so that the right format is used on user preferences.
// 3. You do not need to support more than one language or country to internationalize a program, it just means that you can.
// 4. Internationalization is often abbreviated to i18n
