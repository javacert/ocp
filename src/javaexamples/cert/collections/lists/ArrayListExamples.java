// Notes
// 1. ...

// Scenarios - when to use?
// 1. You need to store a list of something that may have duplicate entries. In this case a Set is not appropriate since
//    we may have duplicates. ArrayList is also better than a LinkedList when you need to access something over and over.
//    Vector and Stack are not used in new code.
